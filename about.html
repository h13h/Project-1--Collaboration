        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="about-content">
            <p>Hello! I'm a passionate photographer with over 10 years of experience in capturing the beauty of the world and the people within it. My journey began with a simple camera, and over the years, I've honed my skills in various photography styles including weddings, portraits, landscapes, and events.</p>
            
            <p>Through my lens, I aim to tell stories that connect emotionally with viewers. Whether it's the raw joy of a wedding day, the serene beauty of nature, or the candid moments in everyday life, I strive to preserve these memories with creativity and authenticity.</p>
            
            <p>Photography is more than just a profession for me â€“ it's a way to express my view of the world. I believe in capturing moments that not only look beautiful but also feel authentic and timeless. Let's work together to create something memorable and unique!</p>
